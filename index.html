   <h2> Little about this King </h2>
  <p>
  
   He was born in January 15, 1929 in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. 
King is best known for advancing civil rights through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.
   
   King led the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and in 1957 became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). He helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.
   On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance.
         
    He was assassinated on April 4, 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities.
         
    Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and a county in Washington was rededicated for him.
